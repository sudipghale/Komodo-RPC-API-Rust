RPC API-Library for Komodo-based asset chains, for Rust Developers
==========================================================================================================================================
Discription
Komodo-RPC library helps you integrate your Rust Apps with Komodo asset-chains without having to setup/implement required RPC functions. Install this Rust library and call Komodo-API RPCs as easily as calling a local function. Komodo-RPC library acts as a wrapper between your Rust app and the Komodo-daemon running on a server.
